Part I

[Verse 1]
I was done in on the weekend
The weekend lasted twenty years
The world's best bulimic bartend
Tender, violent and queer

[Verse 2]
Forgive me father, I have sinned
I've drained my body full of pins
I've danced til dawn with splintered shins
Full of pins, full of pins

[Chorus]
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes

[Verse 3]
They laugh at me when I run
I waste away for fun
I am my father's son
His shadow weighs a tonne

[Chorus]
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes

[Verse 3]
They laugh at me when I run
I waste away for fun
I am my father's son
His shadow weighs a tonne

[Chorus]
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes

[Verse 2]
Forgive me father, I have sinned
I've drained my body full of pins
I've danced till dawn with splintered shins
Full of pins, full of pins

[Chorus]
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Goes and it goes and it goes
Go go go go go go!

It's coming
It's coming
It's coming
It's coming
It's coming
It's coming
It's coming
It's coming

Part II

[Bridge]
I don't want to be your man, your man
I don't want to be your man, your man

[Verse 4]
I'm like Stone Cold Steve Austin
I put homophobes in coffins

I'm like Fred Astaire
I dance like I donâ€™t care

I'm like Ted DiBiase
I win no matter what it costs me

I'm like Evel Knievel
I break bones for my people

I'm on my best behavior
Like Jesus Christ our savior

I'm like Reggie Kray
