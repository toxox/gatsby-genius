[Intro]
When I come to walk the line
The fire may come, but we'll be just fine
When I go to walk the line
The fire, it will come but we'll be just fine

[Verse 1]
Mouth of the ocean, be well spoken
Watch your P's and Q's
Now that we're older, the future is colder
But what is there to do?
I'll walk the line, I'll be just fine
I'll be right back on time
The fire is coming, but we'll outrun it
We'll never be undone

[Chorus]
What came of the things we once believed?
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
Oh, what came of the things we once believed?
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea

[Verse 2]
And now our parents are long departed
Who can finish the songs they started?
Bodies are broken, but it's just a token
Of what is surely to come
Unstitch the suture, please pause the future
So I can collect my things
The fire is coming, but we'll outrun it
We'll never be undone

[Chorus]
What came of the things we once believed?
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
Oh, what came of the things we once believed?
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea

[Bridge]
When I go to walk the line
The fire it comes, but I'll be just fine

[Chorus]
What came of the things we once believed?
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
Oh, all lost and, oh, all lost, to the depths of a hungry sea
Oh, all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
All that's left, all that's left
Is the echo of a roaring sea
Long gone, long gone
To the trace of a memory
What came of the things I once believed?
All that's left, all that's left
Is the trace of a memory
