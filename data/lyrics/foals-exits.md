[Verse 1]
Now the sea eats the sky
But they say it's a lie
There's no birds left to fly
We'll hide out
Oh, the weather's against us
Houses underground
The flowers upside down
In our dreams
In the eye of the storm
The land where you were born
Try to make no sound
We hide out
'Cause they watch us in sleep
The language that we speak
And the secrets that we keep

[Pre-Chorus]
In our dreams, in our dreams, in our dreams
In our dreams, in our dreams, in our dreams

[Chorus 1]
I said I'm so sorry
To have kept you waiting around
I wish I could've come up
I could've shouted out loud
They got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down
In a world upside down

[Verse 2]
Oh, to dream this all off
In the islands of the mind
The places they can't find
We'll hide out
And the black sky came down
And the cities underground
The flowers upside down
In our dreams
Oh, to meet you again
To pass you on the stairs
To see you everywhere
In my dreams
'Cause they watch us in sleep
The language that we speak
And the secrets that we keep

[Pre-Chorus]
To ourselves in our dreams, in our dreams
In our dreams, in our dreams, in our dreams

[Chorus 1]
I said I'm so sorry
To have kept you waiting around
I wish I could've come up
I could've shouted out loud
They got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down

[Chorus 2]
I said I'm so sorry
That the world has fallen down
I wish I could do something more
I could shout it out loud
They got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down
In a world upside down

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge](Up)
(Upside down, oh)
(Upside down, oh)
(Upside down, oh)

[Outro]
Back to the days of yore, when we were sure of a good long summer
I hope you could be found out of ground, our long lost brother
We share all of our dreams into the screen but not with each other
Back to the days of yore, when we were sure of a good long summer
I hope you could be found out of ground, our long lost brother
We share all of our dreams into the screen but not with each other
Back to the days of yore, when we were sure of a good long summer
