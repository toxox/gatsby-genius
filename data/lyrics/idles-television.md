[Verse]
If someone talked to you
The way you do to you
I'd put their teeth through
Love yourself
And that's what they do
The bastards made you
Not want to look like you
So you pay through the nose
To look like someone else
All the weirdos on the shelf
Love yourself
Love yourself
Love yourself

[Chorus]
I go outside and I feel free
'Cause I smash mirrors and fuck TV
I go outside and I feel free
'Cause I smash mirrors and fuck TV

[Verse]
If someone talked to you
The way you do to you
I'd put their teeth through
Love yourself
And that's what they do
The bastards made you
Not want to look like you
So you pay through the nose
To look like someone else
All the weirdos on the shelf
Love yourself
Love yourself
Love yourself

[Chorus]
I go outside and I feel free
'Cause I smash mirrors and fuck TV
I go outside and I feel free
'Cause I smash mirrors and fuck TV

[Bridge]
I spoke to God in my dreams last night
She said I'd go to heaven if my teeth was white
Medicator, medicator, medicator
Numb me from these naysayers
And their crocodile feels
And their crocodile love
And their crocodile tears

[Chorus]
I go outside and I feel free
'Cause I smash mirrors and fuck TV
I go outside and I feel free
'Cause I smash mirrors and fuck TV
And the magazines
Television and magazines
Television and magazines
Television and magazines
